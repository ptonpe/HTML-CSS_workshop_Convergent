      <h2>About Me</h2>
      <p>Hi! My name is Pranav but most people call me PT for short. I was born and raised for part of my life in the Pacific Northwest in Portland so I have been accustomed to cloudy/rainy days and outdoors activities. I am a huge fan of backpacking, hiking, visiting national parks, mountain biking, and just about any other thing nature-related. I moved to Texas back in 2011 where I really began exploring my passions. Throughout high school, I became invested in E-commerce and online branding taking inspiration from my older sister who pursued marketing and graphic design. I took a more technical approach to learning about branding and how it applies to social media.</p>
